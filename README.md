All the source codes are located in the `src` directory, the output files in
`out`, and the executables in `exe`. The makefile is configured to compile
everything within the `src` directory while linking everything inside `lib`.

The figures in the LaTeX document are generated exclusively by the script
`src/plots.R`.
