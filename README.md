All the source codes are located in the `src` directory, the output files in
`out` and the executables in `exe`. To compile a specific file in the top level
of `src`, call `make <n>` with `<n>` being, for example, `6a` for the file
`src/06a_metropolis.c`.

PRNGs and other utilities are inside the `lib` directory. The `src` directory
also contains some R scripts to generate the figures that are included in the
LaTeX documents. They are saved in `tex/img`.
